# Kuro-DLC-Restoration

This mod restores two DLCs which were not available with Steam release of Kuro no Kiseki. The two DLCs are the Old Kingdom Dress for Agnes and the Golden Blood Suit for Judith. This mod is meant to work with the CLE release of Kuro no Kiseki, and is compatible with both of the language options (TC & KR) available.

# Using the mod

Download the t_shop.tbl file and drop it in \THE LEGEND OF HEROES KURO NO KISEKI\tc\f\table folder or \THE LEGEND OF HEROES KURO NO KISEKI\kr\f\table folder if you use the Korean language setting. It is recommended you take a backup of the existing t_shop.tbl file before you replace it.

(To open the Kuro files, go to Steam->Right Click on Kuro no Kiseki->Manage->Browse local files to open the \THE LEGEND OF HEROES KURO NO KISEKI directory.)

Once this is done, please go to Paulette and open the 'Monmart Bistro' Shop. The two items should be available for purchase at 100 Mira each.

# Why Paulette's shop specifically?

Short Answer: It's a meta joke

Long Answer: In the 5th chapter of the Agnes's style spin off manga, Yumé gets Agnès to try on various outfits that belong to Paulette, and the Golden Blood Suit is one of them. So, I decided to place the unobtainable DLC outfits there as a meta joke of Paulette somehow getting them for you.
